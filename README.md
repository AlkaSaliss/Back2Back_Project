# Back2Back_Project

How to launch our project ? 

After cloning the project, the application can be launched with the launch.java class (in the default package). 

Our application requires to specify a few parameters about the dataset and the model before running the launchComparison() method: 
* Parameters about the dataset: 
      * path
 - header (true or false)
 - name of the target, variable to be explained
 - what is the goal of the model ? classification or regression ? Is the target categorial or continuous ? 
 - does the file have row names ? (should the first column be removed ?)
 - what are the separator and the decimal in the file ? 
 - Have the dataset some categorical features ? If so, we have to fill a list with the names of the categorical variables.
